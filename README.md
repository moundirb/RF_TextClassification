# Text Classification with Random Forest

This notebook demonstrates a simple and effective approach to text classification using:
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Random Forest Classifier

It uses a labeled text dataset (e.g., BBC News) to train and evaluate the model.  
Key steps include preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix).

## Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
